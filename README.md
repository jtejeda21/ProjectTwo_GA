----------------

### MVP / Necessary features:


- An interactive board which renders on page load.

- A player can't play on a square that has already been played.



### Intermediate features:


- The game should end when there is a winner, or if the game is a tie.

- The game should report the end state.

- A button on game over to reset the game back to initial state.

- A way to keep track of Player 1 vs. Player 2 wins.

- Additionally you should use the CSS skills that you've gained to ensure a reasonable amount of styling to keep your project presentable.



### Strech goals/ Advanced features:


- An option to play vs. a computer with AI

- Level 1: Random empty space is good enough

- Level 2: Computer chooses a space which immediately blocks a player win.

### User story:


1. As a user, when I open the page, I want to be able to see the game board and a start button, so that I can begin the game

2. As a user, I want to be able to enter my name and have it display on the page, so that I know whether or not it is my turn
 
3. Less of a user a story and more of a technical design choice
 
4. As a user when I click a tile I want my token to be placed in there, so that I can make a move.
 
5. As the second player I want to be able to place my token after player one so that we can compete
  
6. As a user I should only be able to place one marker each turn
