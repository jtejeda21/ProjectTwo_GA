# ProjectTwo_GA


## MVP / Necessary features


A basic implementation of this project must include:

- An interactive board which renders on page load.

- A way for players to set their name.

- A way for players to mark an empty space on their turn. Their turns must alternate. Ex: Player one places an 'x' and then player two places an 'o', followed by player one placing an 'x', etc.

- A player can't play on a square that has already been played.



## Intermediate features


- The game should end when there is a winner, or if the game is a tie.

- The game should report the end state.

- A button on game over to reset the game back to initial state.

- A way to keep track of Player 1 vs. Player 2 wins.

- Additionally you should use the CSS skills that you've gained to ensure a reasonable amount of styling to keep your project presentable.



## Strech goals/ Advanced features


- An option to play vs. a computer with AI

- Level 1: Random empty space is good enough

- Level 2: Computer chooses a space which immediately blocks a player win.
